This "Phishaton" was a hackathon organized by [Outkept](https://outkept.com), who build a community-driven phishing platform.

## Stage 1: Spear-phishing
The first part of the hackathon, spear-phishing, was a phishing attack on the IT department of UZ Leuven. 
Two weeks before the event all participants received a document with all sorts of background information about the company.
Based on that we could try to develop a phishing-mail which would be sent out to the actual IT department a week before the event.
The winners would then be determined based on whose mail got the most clicks and links/attachments opened.
Unfortunately, I myself was quite busy during this period, and wasn't able to participate in this challenge.
At the event we did collectively get to look at the mails submitted, which was very interesting.
The winning mail ended up being a fake Microsoft Teams notification, made to look like a message from the head of the IT department.

## Stage 2: AI-Assisted Phishing
For the second challenge we briefed very shortly on what company sector we could target, without any further information we had 30 minutes to build a phishing mail.
The goal was to see if we could use an AI model to quickly generate a phishing mail. Even when using AI tools it was still very difficult to work under the time pressure.
Once again, after the 30 minutes were up each participant presented their mail. This time we didn't have the feedback from the mails, as they hadn't been sent out yet.
The judge would then decide who was the winner, based on a set of criteria such as believability, danger (what information could be received from the mail) and creativity.

## Stage 3: Vishing
For the Vishing, or voice phishing stage we were divided into two groups, and had 10 minutes to build a scenario to obtain information from our target.
The target was the founder of a local microbrewery. When the 10 minutes were up on of the group members had to call him on the phone and act out the scenario.
We pretended to be someone from the FAVV (Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain), requiring some information for our database.
Sadly, while we managed to extract the same information from the target as the other group, it was (deservedly) decided that their scenario was slightly better.

## Conclusion
I had a great time participating in this hackathon and learning more about phishing attacks.
It was great to socialise with the fellow participants and the organisers.
This was the first hackathon they had ever organized, and every was very well done.

I recently attended the Blended Intensive Programme: Trends in Research and Innovation in the Context of Computer
Science at FH St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences in Austria. The program started with online classes that
introduced us to research methodologies and current trends in computer science. These sessions were insightful and set
the stage for our in-person week in Austria.

At FH St. Pölten, we attended lectures and workshops where students shared their master's and PhD research, providing a
glimpse into cutting-edge innovations. A highlight was our group project to create a fake research proposal.
Collaborating with peers from diverse backgrounds, we developed a proposal that won first place during the final
presentations.

## Exploring Vienna and Bratislava

Beyond academics, I had the chance to explore Vienna and Bratislava. Vienna’s cultural heritage and stunning
architecture, alongside Bratislava’s charming old town, offered a perfect blend of learning and leisure.

## Conclusion

Overall, the program was a remarkable experience, enriching my understanding of computer science research and allowing
me to form lasting friendships.

Kongsberg Gruppen is a Norwegian technology group. They supply systems to customers in various fields such as defence, aerospace, maritime, offshore oil and gas and more.

It comprises three business areas:
- Kongsberg Maritime
- Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace
- Kongsberg Digital

This presentation in particular was held by the Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace division (KDA).
It came to my attention when on a job fair, organised at Østfold University College where I am currently attending an exchange semester, i got to talk to on of the representatives.
He seemed very excited about his job. To him, as a software developer, working so closely with the hardware was amazing. This excitement rubbed off on me, and he invited me to the presentation.

## About Kongsberg

The Kongsberg group is a Norwegian technology group. In total, they have around 12,000 employees, across 39 countries, and multiple business areas. They are rapidly expanding, and opening new offices such as the new office in Moss. 

## Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace 

The Defence & Aerospace arm of the company features around 3,700 employees, and is also rapidly expanding,in part thanks to the wars currently going on. While this is a bit sad, that's the reality of being a Defence contractor.

Of course this means that ethics are extremely important. While it is a publicly traded company, they are majority owned by the government. So it's good to hear that the Norwegian government is very strict in their policy on weapons trade.

While also collaborating on programs such as Lockheed Martin's F-35, these are some of the notable products KDA supplies.
- Penguin anti-ship missile
- Joint Strike Missile (JSM)
- NASAMS 2 ((National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System)
- Naval Strike Missile (NSM)
- Protector Remote Weapon Station (RWS) - with Thales
- Vanguard-class multirole warship
- CROWS II – variant of Protector system
- SuperSonic Strike Missile (3SM)

Seeing the current global trends they recently opened the space and surveillance division. 

## Kongsberg Cybersecurity Centre

Given the sensitivity of some of the operations withing the company, it comes as no surprise that they have a strong focus on cybersecurity. They work closely with the Norwegian authorities to achieve this.
The cybersecurity centre is responsible for the safeguarding of all data and infrastructure within the group. Aside from that they also do some external contracts with 3rd parties. 

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun learning more about this company, getting to know how they work.
Afterward we had drinks and pizza with the team and talked some more about the job opportunities at Kongsberg.

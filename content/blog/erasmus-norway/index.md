Having just wrapped up my semester as an Erasmus student at Østfold University College in Halden, Norway, I am
incredibly grateful for this transformative experience and the wealth of knowledge I've gained over the past few months.
In this blog post, I'll reflect on some of the fascinating activities I engaged in during my time in Norway.

## School

The primary purpose of my stay in Halden was, of course, academic. I undertook three courses, each worth 10 ECTS,
totaling 30 ECTS.

### Practical Machine Learning

This course provided a practical introduction to machine learning. We covered essential topics, including data science,
model implementation, and evaluation. While I had some prior knowledge of the mathematical principles behind machine
learning, this course expanded my understanding by focusing on hands-on application and real-world scenarios.

Throughout the course, we worked on programming exercises and projects that involved building and assessing machine
learning models. This practical approach solidified my skills in implementing and evaluating various machine learning
techniques.

### Digital Control and Cyber-Physical Systems

This course offered a practical introduction to digital control systems and cyber-physical systems (CPS). We covered key
topics such as PID control, state-space representation, and real-time system analysis. The coursework involved
programming exercises and applying theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.

The highlight was the final project, where we wrote our own controller for the Balboa balancing robot. This hands-on
experience deepened my understanding of digital control strategies and the challenges of working with physical hardware.
By the end of the course, I gained valuable skills in programming and troubleshooting CPS.

### Project Management

In this course, we learned the fundamentals of project management by working in groups to complete the planning phase
for a hypothetical startup. Our group project included:

- Executive Summary: An overview of our startup's vision and goals.
- Company Presentation: A detailed presentation introducing our company.
- Value Proposition: A clear statement of the unique value our product offers.
- Product Description: High-level details of our product's features and benefits.
- Business Case/Justification: High-level analysis of the market need and business viability.
- Conceptualization: Detailed layout of our project's scope and objectives.
- Go-to-Market (GTM) Plan: Strategies for sales and marketing.
- Finance: Financial projections and funding requirements.
- Timeline and Plan: A comprehensive schedule outlining project milestones.
- Risks & Stakeholders: Identification and analysis of potential risks and key stakeholders.
- Reflection & Learnings: Insights gained and lessons learned from the project.

This practical experience in project planning equipped me with essential project management skills, including strategic
planning, financial analysis, and risk management.

## Travel

Living in Norway afforded me numerous travel opportunities. Besides exploring Halden and nearby cities like Oslo and
Gothenburg, I embarked on two major trips.

### Lofoten

In early October, I joined a group of fellow Erasmus students on a trip to Lofoten, a northern peninsula known for its
stunning landscapes. Despite harsh weather, we enjoyed scenic hikes and the breathtaking northern lights, making it one
of the most memorable places I've ever visited.

### Lillehammer - Hafjell

Just this month, in between two exams, I travelled one last time before going back to Belgium, this time to Lillehammer.
Lillehammer is of course famous for hosting the 1994 Winter Olympics. There we saw the ski jump and the bobsleigh track,
which I vividly remember being used in Top Gear episodes.
Not quite talented or brave enough to send it down the ski jump I instead headed over to the Hafjell ski resort, which
was used for its downhill track in the winter olympics. While considerably smaller than the ski resorts typically found
in the Alps, the snow here was simply incredible due to the much colder temperatures (around -15°C to -20°C) and
comparatively quite affordable lift passes.

## Sports

Although the university provided excellent sports facilities, I took up running, fulfilling a long-held dream by
participating in the Oslo Marathon. Despite limited training, the experience was exhilarating and painful, but
ultimately rewarding. Running through the streets of Oslo is a memory I will forever cherish, and it has inspired me to
continue running.

## Conclusion

My time as an Erasmus student in Norway has been an incredible journey filled with academic achievements, unforgettable
travels, and personal milestones.
I am proud to have embraced every opportunity, learned invaluable lessons, and created lasting memories.
This experience has undoubtedly enriched my life, and I am excited to carry these experiences and skills into my future
endeavors.

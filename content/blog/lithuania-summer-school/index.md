I recently participated in the Blended Summer School "Applied Cybersecurity: From Theory to Practice" in Kaunas,
Lithuania. As a first-year IT-Cybersecurity student, this program was an invaluable opportunity to delve into the
practicalities of applying security techniques to various systems.

The program began with intensive workshops and hands-on sessions, where we learned to implement and manage cybersecurity
measures. The practical focus allowed me to gain real-world skills and a deeper understanding of the complexities
involved in securing digital systems.

In addition to the academic experience, I had the chance to explore the beautiful city of Kaunas and also visited
Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Vilnius impressed me with its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant
culture.

Overall, the Blended Summer School was an enriching experience that significantly advanced my practical cybersecurity
skills and provided a memorable cultural adventure.
